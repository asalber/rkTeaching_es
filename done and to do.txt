DONE
Version 1.0
- Data manipulation (filterig, recoding, calculating new variables, weighting and tipification).
- Frequency tabulation for one variable (grouped and non grouped data).
- Basic exploratory plots (barchart, histogram, piechart, box and whisker plot, scatterplot)
- Descriptive statistics (min, max, mean, median, mode, variance, std. desviation, coef. of variation, cuasi-variance, cuasi-std. desviation, skewness coef., kurtosis coef, quartiles and percentiles).
- Detailed calculation of descriptive statistics (mean, variance, std. desviationd, coef. of variation, skewness coef, and kurtosis. coef.)
- Parametric hypothesis tests:
	- Means (T test).
	- Variances (F test and Levene test).
	- Proportions.
- Probability distributions:
	- Discrete (Binomial and Poisson)
    - Continous (Uniform, Normal, Chi-square, Student's T and Fisher's F).
- Simulations (Binomial-Poisson law).
 
Version 1.1
- Frequency tabulation for two variables (grouped and non grouped data).
- Use of package ggplot2 for graphics.
- Means plot and interaction plot.
- Sample size calculation for estimatin means and proportions.
- Non parametric tests (Lilliefor and Shapiro-Wilk test for normality, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Friedman test, Chi-square test).
- Concordance analysis (intraclass correlation coef. and Cohen's kappa).

Version 1.2
- New Probability menu that includes:
	- Building of probabilistics spaces of random games (coin tosses, dice roll, extraction of cards, extraction polls) and simulate random experiments.  
 	- Building of probabilistics spaces from sample frequencies.
 	- Combination of probabilistic spaces.
	- Replication of probabilistic spaces.
	- Probability calculation from a probabilistic space.


TODO
- Include normality test of Anderson-Darling
- Include Bartlett's test for homocedasticity on normal distributions. 
- Review post-hoc analysis in Kruskal-Wallis test.
- Include assistant helper to choose the correct test or procedure.
